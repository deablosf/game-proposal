### Rules of the game 
A **_first person Turn based RPG_**; _in combat_ you'll have a set of actions you can perform to defeat the enemies before you. _Out of combat_ you'll choose directions to go, rooms to search and characters to interact with.

### Techincal Challenges
CSS - Setting up enemy positions, clicking to select them for the proceeding actions to take effect to their particular stats.

JS - Adding and removing status effects in a [simple and clean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UigzN-4JR14) way.

### Wireframe
When in **_Combat_** the screen should look something like: 
![Combat](wireframe/C.png) 

When the player is out of  Combat or _OOC_, the screen should look something like this: 
![OOC](wireframe/OOC.png)
